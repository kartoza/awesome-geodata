### QGIS

QGIS Desktop does not provide much data by default, however there are some "Easter Eggs" which let you access data immediately by [typing keywords into the coordinates bar](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog316/index.html#add-user-groups-easter-egg). The most commonly used easter egg is probably "world", which loads the natural earth country boundaries, but because QGIS is an Open Source project you can dig around the[source code](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/2d1aa68f0d044f2aced7ebeca8d2fa6b754ac970/src/app/qgsstatusbarcoordinateswidget.cpp#L113) to get a full list of available easter eggs.

Modern versions of QGIS also include some data services OOTB, including access to the [nominatim geocoding service](https://nominatim.org/) and the Open Street Map XYZ Tile Service

#### QGIS Plugins

- [QuickMapServices](https://github.com/nextgis/quickmapservices), available from the [official plugin repository](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/quick_map_services/), provides easy access to a number of basemap collections as tile services.
- [QuickOSM](https://github.com/3liz/QuickOSM), available from the [official plugin repository](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/QuickOSM/), provides easy access to Open Street Map vector data via the overpass API.
- [Google Earth Engine Data Catalog](https://github.com/sandroklippel/qgis_gee_data_catalog), available from the [official plugin repository](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qgis_gee_data_catalog/), provides easy access to GEE Data within QGIS.

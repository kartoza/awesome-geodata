# Excluded Services

The following list outlines services, agencies and domains which have explicitly opted out of being listed on the awesome geodata list.

Because this service is publicly accessible and managed by git, any modifications (including data removals) are tracked, so please note that all traces may not be easily removed from the repository.

Submitted services should be checked to ensure that they are not operated by any of the listed agencies.
